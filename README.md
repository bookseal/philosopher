# Philosophers Project

ðŸš€ **Looking for a skilled C developer with expertise in real-time, concurrent systems?**  
This project demonstrates my ability to solve complex concurrency problems using POSIX threads and mutexes, skills essential for automotive embedded systems.

## Overview
The **Philosophers** project is part of the core curriculum at Ecole 42, where I developed a multithreaded simulation in C to solve the classical Dining Philosophers problem. The project focuses on handling concurrent processes, thread synchronization, and resource sharingâ€”skills critical for low-level programming, especially in embedded systems and automotive software development.

## Key Features
- **Multithreading**: Implemented using pthreads, simulating real-world parallel processes.
- **Mutex Locks**: Ensured safe access to shared resources (forks), preventing race conditions.
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Structured logic to avoid deadlocks in the simulation.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Customizable number of philosophers and action timings via CLI.

## Why Itâ€™s Relevant to Automotive Industry
- **Real-Time Systems**: Similar to automotive control units (ECUs), this project deals with real-time decision-making and resource allocation.
- **Concurrency Control**: Preventing deadlock and ensuring stability mirrors challenges in automotive software development.
- **Embedded Systems**: This project demonstrates efficient handling of system resources, a key requirement in automotive embedded programming.

## Running the Project
